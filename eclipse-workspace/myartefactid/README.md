Once the code run, the server will be working at the address http://localhost:4567.
The IVS is located at the root of the webserver, thus accessing the forementioned URL is sufficient to get access to the IVS.
Another page, http://localhost:4567/hello, serves to test the server is working on a dumb example (without relying on whether the IVS is working well or not).


Note: The project has been built using the IDE Eclipse, then some configuration files might be inadapted for any other IDE.
