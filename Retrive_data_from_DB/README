This folder introduce how to retrive data from MySql to Google map.
Step1:
create config.php to indicate the database in my local laptop
Step2:
Convert AllgeoHops.csv to  AllgeoHops.xml by using output_xml.php
Step3:
draw the map with index.html which require AllgeoHops.xml to retrive data.

However, we finally should finish all of these in WAN VM. The step for converting .csv to .xml should be ignored. 
So I need to modify these files and descriptions latter.
